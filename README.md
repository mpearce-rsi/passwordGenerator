This is a a random password generator made using JavaScript, in which the user specifies the different types of characters to be used as well as the length of the password, using 'if' statements to add a list of each selected type of character to a string, from which random characters are pulled using a for loop repeated the number of times the user specifies when selecting the length of their password.

Note: There are very few commits on this submission because it was done in a session with my tutor, and I didn't see the comments on last week's homework saying I should be committing more often until this one was already finished. Sorry!
